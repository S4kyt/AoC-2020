## Warning 
### NOTE #01: I thought about why type of ptr I'd like to use and char* Ptr seems what I gotta do, looping through the whole line like it would be a string, seperating each category into its respectively usable variable
### NOTE #02: Its possible that I overthinked it and I could just use the whole input as chars only!
